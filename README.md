Bencodex Viewer
===============

This web app takes a Bencodex blob and displays it on the web.

Todos (help wanted):

 -  [ ] Take a hex-coded blob as well 
 -  [ ] Prettier style
 -  [ ] Dropzone currently obstruct to drag (select) to copy text
 -  [ ] Make `BencodexValue` component usable from other React apps
 -  [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions
